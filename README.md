# BoldDesk Support SDK

The **BoldDesk Mobile Support SDK** enables you to integrate a fully functional help center directly into your mobile application. This allows end-users to access support tickets and Knowledge Base (KB) articles inside the app, reducing the need to open a web browser.

With the SDK, you can:

*   Create a customizable help center dashboard.
*   Enable users to submit support requests with attachments.
*   Offer search and filtering capabilities for KB articles to support self-service.
*   Track ticket status, reply to agents, update, and close tickets.
*   Support both **anonymous** and **authenticated** users through JWT-based authentication.
*   Include push notifications for real-time updates.

The SDK is lightweight, supports theming to match your app’s branding, and guarantees secure authentication.
